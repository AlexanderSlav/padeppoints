# Tournament System Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Advance to Next Round Button Not Working
**Problem**: Frontend had no "Advance to Next Round" button and no API endpoint to handle round advancement.

**Solution**:
- Added new API endpoint `POST /tournaments/{tournament_id}/advance-round` in `app/api/v1/endpoints/tournaments.py`
- Added `advanceToNextRound` function to frontend API service (`padel-frontend/src/services/api.js`)
- Added `handleNextRound` function to `TournamentDetailPage.js`
- Added "⏭️ Advance to Next Round" button that appears for tournament organizers when tournament is active

### 2. ✅ Leaderboard Not Working (400 Bad Request)
**Problem**: Leaderboard API was failing because it tried to access `player.first_name` and `player.last_name` but the User model only has `full_name`.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `get_tournament_leaderboard` and `get_tournament_winner` methods in `app/services/tournament_service.py`
- Changed from `f"{player.first_name} {player.last_name}"` to `player.full_name or player.email or "Unknown Player"`

### 3. ✅ Database DSN Configuration
**Problem**: Database configuration was hardcoded and not flexible.

**Solution**:
- Updated `app/core/config.py` to support configurable database settings
- Added support for `DATABASE_DSN` environment variable override
- Made all database environment variables optional with sensible defaults
- Made other configuration settings (JWT, Google OAuth, etc.) more flexible

### 4. ✅ Missing Tests Directory
**Problem**: No test infrastructure existed.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive test suite in `/workspace/tests/`
- Added unit tests for tournament service and Americano service
- Added integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions
- Created pytest configuration and fixtures
- Added test requirements and documentation

- **Test Database**: Uses in-memory SQLite for fast, isolated testing
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data and database sessions

## Configuration Options

### Database Configuration
```bash
# Option 1: Individual components (with defaults)
DB_HOSTNAME=localhost          # default: localhost
DB_PORT=5432                   # default: 5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres           # default: postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password           # default: password
DB_NAME=padel_tournaments      # default: padel_tournaments

# Option 2: Complete DSN (takes precedence)
DATABASE_DSN=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host:port/dbname
```

### Other Configuration
```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
DEBUG=true
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test types
pytest tests/unit/          # Unit tests only
pytest tests/integration/   # Integration tests only

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

## API Changes

### New Endpoint
- `POST /api/v1/tournaments/{tournament_id}/advance-round` - Advance tournament to next round (organizer only)

### Response Format

  "message": "Tournament advanced to round 2",
  "tournament": {
    "id": "tournament-id",
    "current_round": 2,
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```

## UI Changes

### New Button
- "⏭️ Advance to Next Round" button appears for tournament organizers when:
  - Tournament status is "active"
  - User is the tournament creator
  - Button triggers manual round advancement

### Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages for tournament operations
